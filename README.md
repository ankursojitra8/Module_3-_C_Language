# Module_3_C_Language

1_Basic_Logic_Programs
-->   This section includes fundamental exercises that introduce basic logic and syntax in C programming.
Programs include displaying information, simple calculators, and calculating areas and circumferences of geometric shapes.

2_Conditional_Logic_Programs
-->   These exercises focus on conditional statements like if-else and switch-case. Programs include checking equality, leap year validation,
simple calculators using conditionals, and other logic-based exercises.

3_Looping_Statements_&_Conditional_Statements
-->   This section focuses on exercises that use looping constructs such as for, while, and do-while loops.
These exercises are designed to help you understand and practice how to use loops to perform repetitive tasks efficiently in C programming.
You'll work on tasks that involve iterating through numbers, calculating series, generating patterns, and more.

4_Array_Programs
-->   This section covers array manipulations, including operations on single and multidimensional arrays, sorting, and reversing arrays.
Programs also include exercises on structures and unions.

5_String_Programs
-->  This section includes string manipulation exercises, such as calculating string length, reversing strings, comparing strings, and more complex 
string operations like extracting substrings and finding word occurrences.
